<p>While there are many laws that regulate the use of computers internationally, this section focuses on laws within the United States and the United Kingdom, as they establish a general foundation for the laws which are enforced at an international level. If you have an interest in the laws of any particular region of the world, more information can be found online, including the <a href="https://database.cyberpolicyportal.org">United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) Cyber Policy Portal Database</a> and the <a href="https://unctad.org/topic/ecommerce-and-digital-economy/ecommerce-law-reform/summary-adoption-e-commerce-legislation-worldwide">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Global Cyberlaw Tracker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-cfaa"><a class="header" href="#computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-cfaa">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</strong> (CFAA) was codified in 1986 as <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18%20section:1030%20edition:prelim)">18 U.S.C. § 1030</a> (Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1030). It prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. <strong>CFAA</strong> generally covers activities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Unauthorized Access</code>: Gaining access to a computer system or network without permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Execeding Authorized Access</code>: Accessing a part of a system you are authorized to use, but then using that access to obtain or alter information you are not entitled to.</p>

</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="#admonition-note"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>This particular tenant of the law played an important role in the case <code>Van Buren v. United States</code>, where it was determined that an employee has not violated <strong>CFAA</strong> if they misuse info that they were authorized to access.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Computer Trespassing</code>: Accessing a government computer without authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Computer Fraud</code>: Accessing a protected computer with the intent to defraud and obtain something of value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Damaging a Protected Computer</code>: Knowingly transmitting a program or code that causes damage to a computer, such as a virus or worm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Password Trafficking</code>: Knowingly and with intent to defraud, trafficking in passwords or other information that allows unauthorized access to a computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Extortion</code>: Using threats to damage a computer or obtain information from it to extort money or other things of value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CFAA</strong> applies to both criminal penalties and civil causes of action, allowing individuals and organizations that have suffered damages to sue violators.</p>
<h3 id="health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-hipaa"><a class="header" href="#health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-hipaa">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> was passed in 1996 and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C">Title 45 (Public Welfare)</a>, under parts 160, 162, and 164. It is primarily meant to protect the privacy and security of individuals' health information. It can be broken into two distinct parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>The Privacy Rule</code>: Establishes national standards for the protection of a patients medical records and other individually identifiable health information (Protected Health Information <code>PHI</code>).</p>

</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="#admonition-note-1"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>This gives patients rights, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access and obtain a copy of their own health records</li>
<li>The right to request corrections if they believe information is inaccurate</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>The Security Rule</code>: Addresses the protection of electronic Protected Health Information (<code>ePHI</code>). It requires that covered entities implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HIPPA</strong> also includes a <code>Breach Notification Rule</code>, which requires covered entities and their business associates to notify affected individuals, and in some cases the government and media, of a breach of unsecured PHI.</p>
<h3 id="payment-card-industry-data-security-standard"><a class="header" href="#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="">Payment Card Industry Data Security standard</a> (<code>PCI-DSS</code>) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. It was created by the major payment card brands (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB) through the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI-SSC).</p>
<p><code>PCI-DSS</code> is organized around 12 core requirements, that fall into 6 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems</p>
<ul>
<li>Install and Maintain Network Security Controls.</li>
<li>Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect Cardholder Data</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect Stored Account Data.</li>
<li>Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain a Vulnerability management Program</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software.</li>
<li>Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement Strong Access Control Measures</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know.</li>
<li>Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components.</li>
<li>Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regularly Monitor and Test Networks</p>
<ul>
<li>Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data.</li>
<li>Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain an Information Security Policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any organization which fails to comply with these standards may face fines, a loss of ability to process card payments, and/or increased transaction fees. Compliance is validated annually based on a company's transaction volume. The latest version, <code>4.0</code> was released in March 2022, and became mandatory after March 31, 2025.</p>
<h3 id="federal-information-security-modernization-act-fisma"><a class="header" href="#federal-information-security-modernization-act-fisma">Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Federal Information Security Modernization Act</strong> (<code>FISMA</code>) is United States Federal law, which governs the information security of federal government systems. It requires that every federal agency develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. It was originally passed in 2002 as the Federal Information Security Management Act, but was amended and updated in 2014. FISMA is now codified as <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title44/chapter35&amp;edition=prelim">44 U.S.C., Chapter 35, Subchapter II (§§ 3551–3558)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FISMA</strong> mandates a framework, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A Risk-Based Approach</code>: Agencies must categorize information systems and data based on the potential impact of a breach (low, mid, high), then implement security controls that are appropriate for that risk level.</li>
<li><code>Continuous Monitoring</code>: Requires agencies to continuously monitor their IT systems for vulnerabilities and threats.</li>
<li><code>Required Security Controls</code>: Agencies must implement a set of security controls based on standards and guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</li>
<li><code>Annual Reporting</code>: Agencies must conduct annual security reviews and report the results to the Office of Management and Budged (OMB) and Congress.</li>
<li><code>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authoriy</code>: Codifies DHS's authority to manage information security for federal civilian agencies, provide technical assistance, and issue binding operational directives in response to security threats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="computer-misuse-act"><a class="header" href="#computer-misuse-act">Computer Misuse Act</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents">Computer Misuse</a> act is the main piece of UK legislation that criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems and data, as well as other acts that can impair, or risk, impairing computer operations. It was enacted in 1990. Initially, it had 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Section 1</code>: Makes it an offense to gain unauthorized access to computer material, meaning systems or data.</li>
<li><code>Section 2</code>: Makes it an offense to gain unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate further offenses.</li>
<li><code>Section 3</code>: Makes it an offense to perform unauthorized acts against computer systems, either with intent to impair, or that may cause impairment, even if accidental.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2006, the <code>Police and Justice Act</code> provided some amendments to the <strong>CMA</strong> by updating the wording and emphasizing the need for clear proof of intent before someone can be found to have committed an offense. This also criminalized the making, supplying, or obtaining of materials that are used to commit an offense (such as worms, viruses, trojans, etc.).</p>
<p>In 2015, the <code>Serious Crime Act</code> provided further amendments, enforcing much harsher sentences for unauthorized acts that cause or risk causing serious damage, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illness or Death</li>
<li>Disruption to:
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Government</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This act also updated the territorial scope of an offense to include acts against another country and acts by a UK citizen from another country.</p>
<h3 id="human-rights-act"><a class="header" href="#human-rights-act">Human Rights Act</a></h3>
<p>The Human Rights Act is a piece of UK legislation that was introduced in 1998. It defines the fundamental rights and freedoms that everyone is entitled to. Rights are presented as a series of "articles", incorporates from the European Convention on Human Rights.
The main articles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Part I Article 6</code>: Right to a fair trial
<ul>
<li>Innocent until proven guilty</li>
<li>Evidence gathered through security testing or incident responses in particular must be handled in a manner that preserves integrity to ensure admissibility in court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Part I Article 8</code>: Right to respect for private and family life
<ul>
<li>Everyone has the right to respect for their private life, home, and correspondence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Part II Article I</code>: Protection of property
<ul>
<li>Everyone is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions and no one shall be deprived of this through security testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-uk-data-protection-framework"><a class="header" href="#the-uk-data-protection-framework">The UK Data Protection Framework</a></h3>
<p>The UK Data Protection Framework is the primary legal and regulatory framework used in the United Kingdom to govern how personal data is collected, used, stored, and protected. It is made up of two main pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">The United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation</a>: A comprehensive framework, which defines what protections and rights must be enforced to protect the personal data of UK citizens. It can be broken into 7 key data protection principles:
<ul>
<li><code>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>Lawfulness</code>: The processing of personal data must have a valid legal basis</li>
<li><code>Fairness</code>: Any processing of data must be fair toward the individual and not misleading or deceptive.</li>
<li><code>Transparency</code>: controllers must provide individuals with information regarding the processing of their data in a format that is concise and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Purpose Limitation</code>: Data must be collected for specific and legitimate purposes, which are described at the time of collection and must not be processed for any other reason.</li>
<li><code>Data Minimization</code>: Controllers should not collect unnecessary personal data.</li>
<li><code>Accuracy</code>: Controllers must take every reasonable step to ensure inaccurate personal data is deleted or rectified.</li>
<li><code>Storage Limitation</code>: Controllers must delete data as soon as it ceases to be necessary.</li>
<li><code>Integrity and Confidentiality</code>: Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures the appropriate level of security, including protection against unauthorized processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.</li>
<li><code>Accountability</code>: Controllers and processors are responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with all aforementioned data protection principles.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Hackers use their technical knowledge of how computer systems work in order to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Certain laws help to distinguish between the ethical and unethical behaviors that can be exercised by them. More than this, ethical hackers can use their skills to help businesses and organizations remain in compliance with the laws and standards relevant to their industries. It is the responsibility of any offensive security practitioner to familiarize themselves with the laws that govern what they can and cannot do. But more importantly, use good judgment. Do not cause harm where it is not otherwise necessary.</p>
